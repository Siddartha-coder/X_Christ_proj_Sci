The evolution of mass transportation has fundamentally shifted human civilization.<br>
In the 21st century there are a few countries using powerful electromagnets to develop high-speed trains, called maglev trains. These trains float over guideways using the basic principles of magnets to replace the old steel wheel and track trains. There's no rail friction to speak of, meaning these trains can hit speeds of hundreds of miles per hour.
Yet high speed is just one major benefit of maglev trains. Because the trains rarely (if ever) touch the track, there's far less noise and vibration than typical, earth-shaking trains. Less vibration and friction results in fewer mechanical breakdowns, meaning that maglev trains are less likely to encounter weather-related delays.

**How Do maglev trains work**
The first patents for magnetic levitation (maglev) technologies were filed by French-born American engineer Emile Bachelet all the way back in the early 1910s. Even before that, in 1904, American professor and inventor Robert Goddard had written a paper outlining the idea of maglev levitation .
This is the basic principle behind electromagnetic propulsion. Electromagnets are similar to other magnets in that they attract metal objects, but the magnetic pull is temporary. You can easily create a small electromagnet yourself by connecting the ends of a copper wire to the positive and negative ends of an AA, C or D-cell battery. This creates a small magnetic field. If you disconnect either end of the wire from the battery, the magnetic field is taken away.

The magnetized coil running along the track, called a guideway, repels the large magnets on the train's undercarriage, allowing the train to levitate between 0.39 and 3.93 inches (1 to 10 centimeters) above the guideway [source: Boslaugh]. Once the train is levitated, power is supplied to the coils within the guideway walls to create a unique system of magnetic fields that pull and push the train along the guideway. The electric current supplied to the coils in the guideway walls is constantly alternating to change the polarity of the magnetized coils. This change in polarity causes the magnetic field in front of the train to pull the vehicle forward, while the magnetic field behind the train adds more forward thrust.<br>

Maglev trains float on a cushion of air, eliminating friction. This lack of friction and the trains' aerodynamic designs allow these trains to reach unprecedented ground transportation speeds of more than 310 mph (500 kph)

**Advantages of Maglev:-**<br>
High Level Of Safety.<br>
No Derailment.<br>
Reliability. <br>
High-Speed. <br>
Eco-Friendly. <br>
Costs and Maintenance. <br>
Energy Efficient. <br>
The Quietest Transportation System.<br>
<br>

**Disadvantages of Maglev:-**<br>
Expensive to build, not least because itâ€™s a new and largely untried technology.<br>
Expensive to operate, both to maintain the new technology and because the energy consumption is quite high.<br>
Not immune from the problems of needing a straight route with shallow bends.<br>
Unsuitable for heavy freight (as is high speed wheel on rail), and freight and passenger traffic cannot share the same lines at all.<br>
